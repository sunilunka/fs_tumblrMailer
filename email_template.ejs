    <p>Hey <%= firstName %>, </p>

    <p>
      How are you doing? I'm doing well. It's been like <%= numMonthsSinceContact %> months since we last talked. I'm learning to code full-time at Fullstack Academy and enjoying my time.

    <p>
      I've been blogging about my experiences at Fullstack on my blog. 
      Check out my new posts here:
    <% for(var i = 0; i < latestPosts.length; i++) {%>
      <a><a href=<%= latestPosts[i].href %>> <%= latestPosts[i].title %></a></li>

    <% } %> 
    </p>
    <p>
      Talk soon,
